- Compile and Run
Open the solution, compile and run normally.

- Something useful to know
The main function calls the global entropy computation four times for all of the five datasets -- efficient, inefficient, 100 bins/ 1000 bins for histogram computation.

The efficient b-spline calculation function (efbspline) is recommended since it accelerates the computation significantly.

- About the datasets
Currently there are five datasets here. All of them are tetrahedron mesh stored in *.scalar files, with the same form s.t:
# of vertices
# of cells
x coordinate of the first vertex, y coordinate of the first vertex, z coordinate of the first vertex
.....
x coordinate of the last vertex, y coordinate of the last vertex, z coordinate of the last vertex
id of the first vertex in the first cell,id of the second vertex in the first cell, id of the third vertex in the first cell, id of the fourth vertex in the first cell
....
id of the first vertex in the last cell,id of the second vertex in the last cell, id of the third vertex in the last cell, id of the fourth vertex in the last cell
