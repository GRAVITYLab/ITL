Before running the NEK5000 samples codes, copy the following folders to your home directory. 
   nek5000-example to your home dir. (paths listed below are relative to this location)
   nek5_svn
   The wrapper of ITL

NOTES:

1. The application-dependent subroutines should be defined in the file xxx.usr. The file xxx.f is generated by makenek, amd thus should not be directly edited. However, in order to use the syntax highlight function in editors like emacs, file name with extension .f will be preferred. In such a case, you can create a soft-link w/ extension .f to the .usr file. I ususally name the soft link as xxx.usr.f.

2. for ITL to dump the intermediate result, please create a folder 'dump' under the folder of the sample codes.

SAMPLE CODES:

Currently the following two sample codes have been tested.

eddy_uv/eddy_uv
benard/ray_cr

The procedures and notes to run them are listed below

[eddy_uv/eddy_uv]

cd eddy_uv
change the location of the itl and diy libs in line 34 of makenek (Here  itl means the itl wrapper).
makenek eddy_uv
nekb_linux eddy_uv <num_procs>

[benard/ray_cr]

cd benard
change the location of the itl and diy libs in line 34 of makenek (Here  itl means the itl wrapper).
makenek ray_cr
rm *.sch		# the .sch should be cleared before runing the program in the next line, or the NEK solver won't be executed.
nekb_linux <yyy> 	# <yyy> can be either 'ray_dd', 'ray_dn', or 'ray_nn', which represent different initial solutions.
