Building itl:

cd itl
./configure
make
make install

-------------------

[Building itl via CMake]

Also, cmake can be used to configure and to compile ITL. The following sections describe how to use cmake.

<Command line usage of Cmake>

If the ITL is first time checked out, please properly set up the variables. The meaning of variables is explained in the next section.

- Windows: 
	Launch the GUI-version of cmake (cmake-gui) and then setup the variables.

- Linux: 
	Enter the itl folder and then launch the menu-versuion of cmake (ccmake). The command should be as follows:
	
		ccmake..

<Support generators>

When first use cmake to configure itl, it will be required to setup the using compiler (eg. gcc). The following ones have been testsd
- MSVC 2005 
- MSVC 2008
- GCC:
Entering the folder of itl, and then type the following commands:

	ccmake -G "Unix Makefiles"

- Eclipse:
CMake can also create projects for Eclipse, which requires more steps. First, entering the folder of itl, and then type the following command:

	ccmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makeifles"
	
Then, please follow the instruction in the following URL to add itl to Eclipse:

http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:Eclipse_UNIX_Tutorial#Option_2:_UNIX_Makefile_Generator

<Variables in CMake>
When using CMake, the following variables should be configured. To enter the wizard mode, the '-i' switch can be used with cmaje

- DIY_DIR: 		
	Path where DIY is installed.

- WITH_ITL_API:	
	The flag whether the ITL API for Fortran is built. Currently this value should be OFF. If it is ON, the following variables should be configured too.
	* HDF5_DIR: 	
		Path where HDF5 is installed.
	* MYLIB_DIR: 	
		Path to our own internal libraries, which is only used when WITH_ITL_API is ON.
	* NETCDF_DIR:	
		Path where NETCDF is installed.
	* PNERCDF_DIR:	
		Path where PNETCDF is installed.
	* WITH_PNETCDF:	
		The flag whether PNETCDF (ON) or NETCDF (OFF) is used.

<autofonf versus CMake>

It will be up to the user to user either autoconf or CMake to build ITL. However, it is RECOMMENDED to use only one of them. 

If both of them are used, the generate makefiles can mess with each other, which can cause issue to compile the programs.

Building ITL:

cd ITLib

Configure ITL:

We don't have a configure script yet. We'll develop one soon.

Build ITL:

1. Open user_defs.mk.
2. Edit include and library directories. At present, ITL just need to recognize MPI.
3. Run "make". A file called libITLib.a should be created in ITLib directory on success. 
4. Go to each example directory. 
5. Run "make". An executable should be created in the example directory.

Install ITL:

Currently there is separate install scrip. We'll write one soon.

Run ITL:

To run an example, type:
<executable> <arguemnt file>

Sample argument files are provided in the example directories. Arguments are more or less self-explanatory. 

A few sample data files are proved in the ITLib/sampledata directory.
.vol: 3D regular scalar field. 12 bytes of header storing 3 integers (NX,NY,NZ) followed by a sequence of floats. X changes first, then Y, then Z.
.vec: 3D regular vector field. 12 bytes of header storing 3 integers (NX,NY,NZ) followed by a sequence of 3-tuples of floats (<vx, vy, vz>). X changes first, then Y, then Z.

Computed entropy fields are stored as .vol file.

Read documentation:

Open ..ITL/doc/html/index.html file in a broswer.

Update documentation:

cd ..ITL/doc
Make necessary changes to the Doxyfile. Add/remove directories to look for.
Run the following command:
doxygen Doxyfile
