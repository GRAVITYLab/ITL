Building itl:

cd itl
./configure
make
make install

-------------------

Building itl via CMake:

Also, cmake can be used to configure and to compile ITL. 

For gcc users, once entering the folder of itl, type the command 'CMake -G "Unix Makefiles".

For Eclipse users, once entering the folder of itl, type the command 'make -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makeifles". 
Then, please follow the instruction in the following URL to add itl to Eclipse:

http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:Eclipse_UNIX_Tutorial#Option_2:_UNIX_Makefile_Generator

-------------------
autofonf versus CMake:

It will be up to the user to user either autoconf or CMake to build ITL. However, it is RECOMMENDED to use only one of them. 

If both of them are used, the generate makefiles can mess with each other, which can cause issue to compile the programs.

Building ITL:

cd ITLib

Configure ITL:

We don't have a configure script yet. We'll develop one soon.

Build ITL:

1. Open user_defs.mk.
2. Edit include and library directories. At present, ITL just need to recognize MPI.
3. Run "make". A file called libITLib.a should be created in ITLib directory on success. 
4. Go to each example directory. 
5. Run "make". An executable should be created in the example directory.

Install ITL:

Currently there is separate install scrip. We'll write one soon.

Run ITL:

To run an example, type:
<executable> <arguemnt file>

Sample argument files are provided in the example directories. Arguments are more or less self-explanatory. 

A few sample data files are proved in the ITLib/sampledata directory.
.vol: 3D regular scalar field. 12 bytes of header storing 3 integers (NX,NY,NZ) followed by a sequence of floats. X changes first, then Y, then Z.
.vec: 3D regular vector field. 12 bytes of header storing 3 integers (NX,NY,NZ) followed by a sequence of 3-tuples of floats (<vx, vy, vz>). X changes first, then Y, then Z.

Computed entropy fields are stored as .vol file.

Read documentation:

Open ..ITL/doc/html/index.html file in a broswer.

Update documentation:

cd ..ITL/doc
Make necessary changes to the Doxyfile. Add/remove directories to look for.
Run the following command:
doxygen Doxyfile
